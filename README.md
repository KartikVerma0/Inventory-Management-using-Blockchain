# Inventory Management Smart Contract

Welcome to the Inventory Management Smart Contract repository! This project aims to provide a solution for managing inventory using the Ethereum blockchain and Solidity smart contracts. The smart contract allows users to store product details such as Item ID, Item Name, Item Quantity, and Item Price securely on the blockchain. Users can perform various operations including adding new items, selling existing items, reducing item quantity in inventory, editing existing items, displaying item details, and identifying items that are out of stock.

## Features

-   **Secure Storage**: Utilizes Ethereum blockchain and Solidity smart contracts for secure and tamper-proof storage of product details.
-   **Add New Items**: Easily add new items to the inventory with relevant details.
-   **Sell Items**: Facilitates the selling of existing items while updating the inventory accordingly.
-   **Edit Items**: Allows for the modification of existing item details such as name, quantity, and price.
-   **Display Item Details**: Provides functionality to display details of specific items stored in the inventory.
-   **Out of Stock Identification**: Enables users to identify items that are currently out of stock.

## Smart Contract

The smart contract is written in Solidity. You can find the contract code in the `Inventory.sol` file.

## Usage

To deploy and interact with the smart contract, you can use tools like Remix IDE or Truffle Suite. Follow these steps:

1. **Copy the Smart Contract Code**: Copy the Solidity code provided above into your Solidity development environment.

2. **Compile the Smart Contract**: Compile the smart contract to generate the ABI (Application Binary Interface) and bytecode.

3. **Deploy the Smart Contract**: Deploy the compiled smart contract to an Ethereum blockchain network (such as Ganache for development or Ethereum Mainnet for production).

4. **Interact with the Smart Contract**: Use web3.js, ethers.js, or a similar library to interact with the deployed smart contract. You can perform operations like adding new items, selling items, editing item details, displaying item details, and checking item availability.
